This site will be collection of personal engineering and computing projects.  system architecture — often using unconventional methods.

Featured projects include Y.A.R.P., a fully relay-based processor built from electromechanical components, and a custom Relay Simulator used to design and test complex logic circuits in software. If you're interested in computer architecture, digital logic, or building systems from first principles, you’re in the right place.
