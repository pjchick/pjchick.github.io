While trying to build my relay computer I became frustrated at the lack of available software to model Relay Logic. Other simulators out there were either VERY expesive or could not model relay logic in a useable way. So I did what anyone else would do in my position - I spent close to six months writing my own!!

The result is RelaySim and I hope others will find it useful and help contribute to it's ongoing development.
