The most important question you may be asking is...

'Why is it called YARP?' 

Firstly, I believe every project should have a good acronym. Some of the best suggestions from https://acronymify.com/  gave me...

- TELETYPE - TwELvE biT relaY comPutEr - This was a serious contender.
- ENCRYPT - ENhanCed RelaY comPuTer - another possibility.
- REACT - RElAy CompuTer - I think that's already taken.
- TAROT - ulTimAte Relay cOmpuTer - a bit too dark arts for me.

Secondly, One of my favourite films is 'Hot Fuzz', so the decision was easy.

YARP - Yet Another Relay comPuter

Maybe if I build a another version I could call it

NARP - Not Another Relay comPuter

I'll get my coat..
