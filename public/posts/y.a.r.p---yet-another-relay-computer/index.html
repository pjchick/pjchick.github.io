<p>A RAM chip will be used for main memory. However I want to integrate some other discreet memory devices along side (Relay RAM or Capacitor RAM) just to prove it <em>could</em> work if I had enough time or budget to build a 4096 * 12 bit memory storage by hand! This I feel is an honourable compromise.
If I&rsquo;m going to <del>cheat</del> compromise on the RAM - I might as well make the most of it! So my plan will be to use a microcontroller (with wifi) for the RAM. In normal operation the microcontroller will function as basic RAM - implemented as many others have done. However it will also give me the ability to write a debugging interface. The goal will be to view, edit, load and save the memory from a terminal browser or telnet session etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Diagnostic card is also planned that will be able to view the busses and manipulate the key control lines. Again useful for diagnostics as it&rsquo;s being built but would also server another purpose as the ultimate goal would be to put this computer &lsquo;on the net&rsquo; so people could write their own programs and run them remotely!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally no electronics project would be complete without a &lsquo;555&rsquo; timer! So their will be a second clock source built around one of these - just to annoy the purists!</p>

<p>The computer is 12-bits. 12-bit Address bus, 12-bit Data bus and 12-bit ALU.</p>
<p>Using a 12-bit data bus and 12-bit instruction register has given me much more flexibility with the instruction set. I settled on 12-bits as I thought is was the sweetspot (for me). I can play with large&rsquo;ish numbers (4095 max), I can have a much larger instruction set, and I&rsquo;d never need more that 4096 bytes of memory in reality - a 16 bit address range would be overkill. As for the number of relay&rsquo;s used - it will take more relays - but I don&rsquo;t think the amount will be as significant as I first thought as I am increasing the data-bus but reducing the address bus across the design.</p>
<p>The main ALU can add , subtract , increment and decrement. The shifting card can Shift or Rotate the B or C register.

The majority of my inspiration and designs are based on the EXCELLENT relay computers built by Paul Law - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@paul80nd">https://www.youtube.com/@paul80nd</a>, DipDot - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@dipdoting">http://www.youtube.com/@dipdoting</a> and Harry Porter - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@hhp3">http://www.youtube.com/@hhp3</a> &hellip;with just a little of my own lunacy thrown in!</p>
