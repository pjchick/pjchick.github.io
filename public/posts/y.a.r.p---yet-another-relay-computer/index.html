<meta name="description" content="Goals
I want to try and test the limits of what a relay computer is ultimately capable of. Using the amazing Harry Porter and Paul Law designs as a starting point I want to see where I can take it.
These goals include:-

Support ALL logic gate functions (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT).
Add Subtract, increment and decrement in hardware.
A stack with PUSH, POP and PEEK (Circular buffer).
Basic hardware interrupts.

Side projects (so far) include:

Building some form of paper tape reader / writer (for 12-bit data!)
A &lsquo;ROM cartridge&rsquo; / boot loader.
Custom case to make it &lsquo;portable&rsquo; (but I&rsquo;ll settle for luggable!). I want to be able to take this to maker fair&rsquo;s and let people interact with it as much as possible.
A true Random Number Generator. I&rsquo;m imagining a marble drop machine with 12 channels at the bottom, when you ask for a random number it reads the colour of the balls (black or white) before re circulating them back up to be dropped again. Loud, Madness but fun!
Human Clock. The main computer clock will similar to other designs, however I want to build a large box with a hand wheel, where someone can literally &lsquo;crank&rsquo; the clock pulses into the machine.

Constraints

Everything to do with the core computing functions of the machine has to be done by relay&rsquo;s (except Memory - see below).
Diodes can be used to stop back-feeding signals but at a minimum.
LED&rsquo;s are allowed for monitoring and purposes on the card&rsquo;s - the more blinkin&rsquo; lights the better!
